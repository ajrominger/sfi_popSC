Human activities are often seen as detrimental to biodiversity.  We will explore the science and sociology behind this narrative.  We will both delve into the math behind extrapolations of species diversity and loss, and illuminate the shortcomings of the false dichotomy between humans and nature. Predicting biodiversity loss in ecology and conservation biology has historically been viewed through the lens of direct population destruction, habitat loss, and climate change. The amount of suitable habitat has played an especially important role in theories of biodiversity loss due to human activities because area mediates population size and is affected by all forms of habitat destruction including climate change. Thus we will focus heavily on theories of how biodiversity responds to changes in area. Predictions of biodiversity loss have failed to consider the bias scientists bring to such predictions.  We will therefore also explore how presumptions, largely dating to the Victorian era, about the ways species interact, including with the human species, have limited insight into biodiversity dynamics and conservation.
